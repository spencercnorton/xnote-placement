XNote's own reviewed capture: an isolated profile with invented notes, nothing personal.

[XNote](https://github.com/spencercnorton/xnote) keeps each sticky note as its
own window, and since version 3.0 it is a native Wayland application. Under
Wayland a client cannot place its own window — no position, no monitor, no
workspace — so XNote remembers a note's size but not where it was. This
extension is the compositor side of that job, for GNOME Shell 50 on Wayland.

## What it does

**Remembers where every note is.** As you move or resize a note, the
extension records its position, its monitor and its workspace. The record is
keyed by the note, not by the window, so it survives XNote restarts.

**Puts it back.** When a note opens — after a login, after XNote restarts,
after a hidden note is shown again — it goes back to the recorded spot.
Nothing to configure; there are no settings.

**Matches by title, guesses nothing.** XNote's pads are plain windows with no
identity the compositor can see, so the extension reproduces each note's
title — its first line as XNote displays it, formatting stripped — from its
local file and matches on that. Notes that share a first line are handed out
in a stable order, visible notes before hidden ones, and one that is already
open keeps the record of the place it occupies. A note that cannot be matched
is left exactly where the compositor put it.

**Knows which monitor is which.** Monitors are keyed by serial number first,
because identical models cannot be told apart otherwise and a monitor's index
reshuffles when a display wakes late or a KVM switches inputs. A note whose
monitor is not connected stays where the compositor put it rather than going
off-screen, and every note is clamped into the work area.

**Waits for the compositor to finish.** A new XNote window is 0×0 for the
first ~90 ms and mutter places it twice before it settles. Until a window has
settled, every geometry signal is the compositor's: the extension re-asserts
the stored place and records nothing, which converges without a magic delay.

## Install

### Ubuntu 26.04 — from the APT repository

The same repository that serves XNote; `sudo apt install xnote` already
pulls this package in as a recommendation.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://apt.globalentry.systems/setup.sh | sudo sh
sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-xnote-placement
```

Log out and back in (a newly installed extension is discovered at login),
then enable it:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable xnote-placement@spencercnorton.github.io
```

### Any GNOME Shell 50 desktop — from a release

Any GNOME Shell 50 session on Wayland, with XNote 3.0.2 or later installed.
Download `xnote-placement.shell-extension.zip` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/spencercnorton/xnote-placement/releases/latest), then:

```bash
gnome-extensions install --force xnote-placement.shell-extension.zip
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spencercnorton/xnote-placement.git
cd xnote-placement
install -d ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/xnote-placement@spencercnorton.github.io
install -m 0644 extension.js metadata.json \
  ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/xnote-placement@spencercnorton.github.io/
```

After either, log out and back in, then `gnome-extensions enable
xnote-placement@spencercnorton.github.io`. The extension is not on
extensions.gnome.org yet. It does nothing on X11.

**Upgrading from 1.0.x:** the extension's UUID changed to
`xnote-placement@spencercnorton.github.io`. Disable the 1.0.x extension,
remove its `xnote-placement@…` directory under
`~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/`, install this one, log out and back
in, enable it. Saved geometry is kept — the state directory did not change.

## Documentation

- [How it works](docs/how-it-works.md) — matching a window to a note, the
  storage format, the timing measurements, and why this is an extension
  rather than a feature of XNote
- [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — one entry per release

## Where your data lives

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.local/state/xnote-placement/geometry.json` | One record per note: position, size, monitor (serial and connector) and workspace. Directory `0700`, file `0600`. |
| `~/.config/xnote/info-*`, `content-*` | XNote's own note files. Read only: which content file belongs to which note, whether it is hidden, and the first line of each note, to match a window to its record. |

Nothing leaves the machine: the extension has no network functionality.

## Contributing and support

- Bugs and feature requests: [open an issue](https://github.com/spencercnorton/xnote-placement/issues/new/choose). Questions: [Discussions](https://github.com/spencercnorton/xnote-placement/discussions).
- Security reports: [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/spencercnorton/xnote-placement/security/advisories/new) — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). There is no e-mail address; that is deliberate.
- Pull requests are welcome; read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first — this repository is a release mirror, and accepted changes ship in the next tagged release.

## Development

```bash
cp extension.js /tmp/extension.mjs && node --check /tmp/extension.mjs   # what CI runs: parses as an ES module
python3 tests/static-check.py                                          # the release invariants
scripts/build-deb.sh /tmp/dist                                         # the .deb the APT repository publishes
shellcheck scripts/build-deb.sh
```

The behavioural test — a nested headless GNOME Shell, five notes and a
hidden one, XNote relaunched, every visible note asserted back, then
simulated screen locks and a login-time start —
depends on a private harness and runs on the maintainer's desktop before
every release.
